# JSEncoder

JSEncoder is a tool to transform any Javascript file into a file containing just the characters `[]{}()!=>`. See [this video]() for detailed explanation on how this is achieved.

## How to use

### Mac / Linux

First give access to `encode` script by executing `chmod u+x encode`. Then execute:

``` terminal
> encode [input file] [output file]
```
